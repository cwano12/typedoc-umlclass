# How to migrate from older versions to 0.4

You were using this plugin before and are now getting TypeDoc errors about unknown options?

## What happened?

With version 0.4.0 I moved all the options into a single object called `umlClassDiagram`.
This means that you can no longer specify the options of this plugin via command line arguments.

**The list of options, their possible values and their default value did not change.**

The migration shouldn't take you longer than a few minutes.
The name of the options did change slightly as I could now get rid of the `umlClassDiagram` prefix.

## What to do?

If you weren't already using a [TypeDoc JSON option file](https://typedoc.org/guides/options/),
you will now have to create one with the said object.

Here is an example showing all available options and their default value:

```json
{
    "entryPoints": ["./src/index.ts"],
    "out": "doc",
    "umlClassDiagram": {
        "type": "detailed",
        "location": "local",
        "remoteBaseUrl": "http://www.plantuml.com",
        "format": "svg",
        "sectionTitle": "Hierarchy-Diagram",
        "position": "above",
        "legendType": "only-included",
        "methodParameterOutput": "complete",
        "memberOrder": "public-to-private",
        "hideEmptyMembers": true,
        "topDownLayoutMaxSiblings": 6,
        "visibilityStyle": "icon",
        "hideCircledChar": false,
        "hideShadow": false,
        "boxBackgroundColor": "",
        "boxBorderColor": "",
        "boxBorderRadius": 0,
        "boxBorderWidth": -1,
        "arrowColor": "",
        "classFontName": "",
        "classFontSize": 0,
        "classFontStyle": "normal",
        "classFontColor": "",
        "attributeFontName": "",
        "attributeFontSize": 0,
        "attributeFontStyle": "normal",
        "attributeFontColor": "",
        "generatorProcessCount": -1,
        "hideProgressBar": false,
        "createPlantUmlFiles": false,
        "verboseOutput": false
    }
}
```
