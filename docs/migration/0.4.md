# How to migrate from older versions to 0.4

First of all, I'm sorry for the inconvenience this might be causing you.
We all hate having to adopt to changes that are forced upon us.
To make the migration as easy as possible for you, I decided to create this short migration guide.

You were using this plugin before and are now getting TypeDoc errors about unknown options?

## What happened?

That is because with version 0.4.0 I moved all the options into a single object called `umlClassDiagram`.
This means that you can no longer specify the options of this plugin via command line arguments.

**The list of options, their possible values and their default value did not change.**
Their names did change as I could now get rid of the `umlClassDiagram` prefix for all the options.
The migration shouldn't take you longer than a few minutes.

## What to do?

If you weren't already using a [TypeDoc JSON option file](https://typedoc.org/guides/options/),
you will now have to create one with the said object.

Here is an example showing all available options and their default value:

```json
{
    "entryPoints": ["./src/index.ts"],
    "out": "doc",
    "umlClassDiagram": {
        "type": "detailed",
        "location": "local",
        "remoteBaseUrl": "http://www.plantuml.com",
        "format": "svg",
        "sectionTitle": "Hierarchy-Diagram",
        "position": "above",
        "legendType": "only-included",
        "methodParameterOutput": "complete",
        "memberOrder": "public-to-private",
        "hideEmptyMembers": true,
        "topDownLayoutMaxSiblings": 6,
        "visibilityStyle": "icon",
        "hideCircledChar": false,
        "hideShadow": false,
        "boxBackgroundColor": "",
        "boxBorderColor": "",
        "boxBorderRadius": 0,
        "boxBorderWidth": -1,
        "arrowColor": "",
        "classFontName": "",
        "classFontSize": 0,
        "classFontStyle": "normal",
        "classFontColor": "",
        "attributeFontName": "",
        "attributeFontSize": 0,
        "attributeFontStyle": "normal",
        "attributeFontColor": "",
        "generatorProcessCount": -1,
        "hideProgressBar": false,
        "createPlantUmlFiles": false,
        "verboseOutput": false
    }
}
```

The easiest way to migrate is probably:

1. Copy the example object above into your config file.
2. Remove all options whose default value is OK for you.
3. Change the value of the options to the ones you were using before.

If you are having trouble, please let me know by opening a new issue on Github. Thank you.
